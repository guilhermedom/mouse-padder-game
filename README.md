# Mouse Ping Pong

Browser game developed using JavaScript canvas.

## Rules
Every time the ball touches one side of the screen, the player playing on the opposite side scores one point. The first to reach 5 points wins the game.

## How to Play
The player is supposed to defeat the computer AI by making the ball reach the right side of the screen.  
  
Use the mouse movement to control your pad. Pushing the mouse forward makes the pad go up and pulling the mouse backwards makes the pad go down. 
  
Like any famous pong game you're supposed to hit the ball whenever it comes close to your side of the screen, avoiding that it makes to your side of the block. Hitting the ball with the center of the pad reduces its velocity and sends it in a more straight way than it came. 
  
Striking the ball with the borders of the pad creates a crossing effect and accelerates the velocity of the ball. Beware that the ball can bounce on the sides of the block.
